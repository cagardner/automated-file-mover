    "\n",
    "- **`on_created` method**: Activated when a new file is created. It checks to make sure the event is for a file (not a directory). If it's a file event, it calls the `organize_files` method with the path of the newly created file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`organize_files` method**: Organizes individual files into appropriate sub-folders based on their file extensions.\n",
    "  - It first determines the file's extension and converts it to uppercase (e.g., `.pdf` becomes `PDF`).\n",
    "  - If a file doesn't have an extension, it assigns it to a default folder named `OTHERS`.\n",
    "  - It checks if a sub-folder named after the file type (or `OTHERS`) exists in the `DOWNLOADS_FOLDER`. If not, it creates one.\n",
    "  - Finally, it moves the file into the corresponding sub-folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the code watches for new files being added to a directory. When a new file appears, it organizes that file into a sub-folder based on its file type. If the file doesn't have a recognizable type, it places it in a folder named `OTHERS`."
